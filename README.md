<h1 align="center">CopyRaw</h1>

An Inkscape Extension I made for myself.

Copies raw SVG directly instead of saving it as an optimized SVG, then opening it in a text editor, Ctrl-a + Ctrl-c, you know all of that stuff. 

# How to use

1. Select paths/strokes/whatever.
2. Go to `Extensions -> Custom -> CopyRaw.`
3. Copy the SVG text from the box that pops up. (index.utils.debug() for now)
